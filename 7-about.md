# ABOUT

## Who we are

Futuro Sin Mundo is a data, research and journalism project of PODER to make transparent information about the real beneficiaries and the supply chain of heated tobacco products. The objective is to provide information from a critical point of view on the main impacts of the manufacture of these products and that decisions regarding their commercialization in Mexico are supported by evidence.

This project has been produced with the help of a grant from Vital Strategies on behalf of Bloomberg Philantropies. The contents of this site are the sole responsibility of the authors and can under no circumstances be regarded as reflecting the positions of the donors.

## Methodology
All the statements published herein are duly substantiated with information from the companies' annual, financial and sustainability reports, reports filed with the Securities Exchange Commission, the Official Journal of the Federation and the Public Registry of Commerce. In addition, reports and academic papers were consulted and are duly referenced in the research report and the journalistic report.

## Visualization & microsite:
The project uses the Tower Builder system, created by PODER, to generate websites with data visualizations. It is designed to follow money and corporate structures, and has been used previously to monitor large public works such as The Business of the Mayan Train, private works such as The New Threat of Grupo Mexico and the purchase of medicines and vaccines such as Living with HIV and The Business of Vaccines$.
