# WORLD-LESS FUTURE

{:.main-text}
Heated tobacco products are marketed through a marketing strategy that presents them as reduced-risk and therefore less harmful devices. However, their production is complex and highly dependent on an industry that generates environmental, health and human rights impacts. This information is hidden due to the lack of transparency and complexity of their supply chain and is essential for people to make more informed decisions.
